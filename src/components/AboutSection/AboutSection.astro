          I'm an experienced frontend engineer for over 6 years now. I've been using ReactJS ever
          since and have progressed into incorporating TypeScript and NextJS in my technology stack.
          I'm also proficient in other front-end development technologies and tools. I'm still
          actively and passionately polishing my craft as well as keeping up to date with new
          technologies.

          I have been exposed into working with different clients under different projects, teams
          and culture over the years in this industry. I'm currently working as a senior frontend
          engineer for a UK-based company in maintaining and developing new features for an
          e-commerce web application. In the past, I have worked with another British client in
          building CRM-related web applications where I'm reporting directly to the company's CTO
          and I've also worked with a Japanese client in maintaining and building the UI of their
          multi-functional printer panel and even got deployed in Japan for over half a year.

          I'm a diligent and self-motivated person. I'm passionate at my craft and I'm interested in
          furthering my knowledge in web technologies. I'm currently honing my front-end and UI/UX
          development skills but I'm open to venture into other fields in software development such
          as mobile development, back-end development among others.
